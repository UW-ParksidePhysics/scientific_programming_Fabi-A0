Partner: No partner when done in class had a friend go over it though 

What Went Well
--- We communicate well the order of doing the procedure 


What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus: 10/10 we were steady but can be better always

* Communication: Now when the other has finished a step at a better tempo so as to be more smooth 

* Pacing: 10/10 we didnt felt slowed down from the step process 

* Division of responsibility: one read and I did the command line

* Code quality:Could be better I did double verification all the time was no necessary based on what was written.
